Extensibility:

I. Standard Extensibilities

Many patterns naturally will relate function and structure in general ways which we can understand.  Understanding these well in terms of design and extensibility is the difference between a job and a doingness. Let's take a look at how these break down.

    i.      Relating Supercomplexity toward Swith*

    Here we issue toward reuse of standard patterns in terms their manifold across and relating to the patterns issued at design and post-design time - specifically where these extend structure and therefore function beyond the simple interlinking of well understood pattern(s).

    We issue then in keeping with standard ordering logic the following:

        a. You will add components to a component

        b. You will add components to a series of components

        c. You will add components to a queue or very similar

        d. You will add components to a system

        e. You will add components to a logic

        f. You will add components pre/post/during design time

    ii.     Direct System Related Extensibility Mapping

    The backing system is the object here; as we add to the program we need the extensibility in terms of speed and ease.  We add functionality in terms of understanding to maintain this edge in the sort.

    iii.    Indirect System Related Extensibility Mapping

    The programmer and/or designer are the object here.  Clear cut case of adding complexity by adding external constraints that are not a direct system value.

    iv.     Reorganization and Cleanliness

II. Specific Extensibilities

Certain patterns will have specific

Swith: Super-smooth, low-latency coolness,, again

Darth: Break-even point for emperor
