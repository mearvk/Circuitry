Extensibility:

I. Standard Extensibilities

Many patterns naturally will relate function and structure in general ways which we can understand.  Understanding these well in terms of design and extensibility is the difference between a job and a doingness. Let's take a look at how these break down.

    i.      Relating Supercomplexity toward Swith*

    Here we issue toward reuse of standard patterns in terms their manifold across and relating to the patterns issued at design and post-design time.

    ii.     Direct System Related Extensibility Mapping

    The backing system is the object here; as we add to the program we need the extensibility in terms of speed and ease.  We add functionality in terms of understanding to maintain this edge in the sort.

    iii.    Indirect System Related Extensibility Mapping

    The programmer and/or designer are the object here.  Clear cut case of adding complexity by adding external constraints that are not a direct system value.

    iv.     Reorganization and Cleanliness

II. Specific Extensibilities

Certain patterns will have specific
